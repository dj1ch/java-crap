/*
 * Note:
 *
 * Sequential Search
 * The first approach is to use a sequential search algorithm.
 * The sequential search algorithm searches every element in the array until it finds the value that it's looking for.
 * Or, until it arrives at the end of the array.
 * This algorithm is okay for small arrays but it's inefficient for arrays with more than several thousand elements.
 *
 * Binary Search
 * Another search algorithm is the binary search. For the binary search the array must first be sorted.
 * So, in the case of our lottery ticket array, the elements would need to be in ascending order from least to greatest.
 * Then you will write code that will begin the search, by checking the element in the middle of the array,
 * to see if it's equal, greater than, or less than the value that you're searching for.
 * If it's greater than, then there's no need to search the entire second half of the array.
 * Because we know, that everything over there will be greater than as well.
 * And the element you're searching for is definitely not over there.
 * Likewise, if the middle number is less than the value you're searching for,
 * then there's no need to search the entire first half of the array.
 * And if the value is equal, you're lucky and you're done.
 * If it's not equal you've still eliminated half of the array where you know the value is not,
 * and then you continue with another iteration.
 * Each iteration continues like this â€” eliminating half of the array for what needs to be searched,
 * until you find the value, or you search the entire array.
 * This is a much quicker approach than the sequential search.
 * And this algorithm is one that you should definitely know as it's often brought up in tech interviews.
 * You can code all of this by hand. But if you need to use this in real life,
 * simply use this handy util method called Arrays.binarySearch().
